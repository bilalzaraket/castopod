# Tutorials to use:

- for php as a start: https://youtu.be/OK_JCtrrv-c

- for codeigniter: https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/codeigniter-tutorial#:~:text=CodeIgniter%20Tutorial%3A%20The%20Complete%20Guide%201%20Set%20Up,3%20Create%20a%20Simple%20App%20with%20CodeIgniter%20

- Docker and containerization, composer package manager for php

- MVC architecture: use Polytech's design pattern course about mvc (in semester 8)

# Some tips:

- In case you want to change the modules imported in the container dev, you can just change the docker-compose.yaml configuration file

- In case you want to add more libraries (ocp, ...) you can add these libraries in the compose.json file (in the require array)
